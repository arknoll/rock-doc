Overview \u00b6 Make Sure Before proceeding to the LiDAR Calibration make certain the base station is setup and logging static RINEX 3.03 measurements Calibrating the LiDAR is an important step to collecting accurate data, and the procedure will be done twice at each acquisition session. One time at the beginning, right after you start the R1A from the WebServer.

Procedure \u00b6 Start the R1A LiDAR \u00b6 Using the web interface, wait until you have 8 or more GNSS satellites. Then press the start button inside the data recording window.

If you are using another acquisition vehicle refer to the Community for additional help. Setup your Base Station \u00b6 A highly accurate trajectory is necessary for accurate results from the R1a. In order to obtain this accurate trajectory you must use a GNSS base station. We recommend the Emlid Reach RS2 . Follow the RS2 documentation for setting up your base station.

One of them is stationary and is called \u201cbase station\u201d, the other one, on the ROCK R1A, is the \u201crover\u201d. The base station measures errors, and knowing that it is stationary transmits corrections to the rover (refer to How RTK and PPK works for more information about RTK and PPK). Typically the distance between the Base and the R1A rover shouldn't exceed 10 km due to the ionospheric effect. A general rule of thumb is, you will lose 2 parts in accuracy per million. (i.e. at 10 km you will lose 2 cm of accuracy) Because of this we recommend to always have a base station located within 10 km of your project area. This article will give you a good understanding of different ways to set up the base to help you attain the desired accuracy for your application. In this tutorial we will show discuss 3 scenarios for setting up your base. Setting up over known Point (High Global Accuracy) Setting up over unknown (Post-Processing Position, High Global Accuracy) Setting up over unknown (relative accuracy) Absolute and relative position \u00b6 ROCK cloud has several ways to determine your position with varying levels of accuracy. Let's take a look at the illustration below (figure 1). The ROCK Cloud algorithm can precisely calculates the distance between the base and R1A rover. This distance is called the Baseline. The R1A rover position is precisely determined relative to the Base position. The more precisely we can locate our base station then the more accurate our location for the rover will be, and as a result, the accuracy for our LiDAR data. Any offset from the true location on the base station from the true location will be directly applied to the rover coordinates offset, and by extension to our LiDAR data. Figure 1 It is often enough to know the precise position of an object relative to other objects inside the scan area. This would preserve measurements made on the LiDAR model, but lose where these measurements are located on earth. However, for applications like surveying and mapping it is critical to get an accurate absolute position for your base station. In this case, the offset \u0394X, \u0394Y, \u0394Z between actual True position and the Base station position should be avoided or reduced. The absolute position of the rover and therefore the LiDAR data is accurate only to the same accuracy as the position of the base station. In the below figure 2 is an illustration showing the effects of the base station location being off from the true location. As you can see, if the base station computed location is off from the true position, then the R1A rover and likewise the LiDAR data is shifted by the same amount. Next, we will discuss 3 methods of locating your base station to be uploaded to the ROCK cloud. Figure 2 Ways to Set the Base Station \u00b6 Setting over a Known Point Setting over an unknown point with post processing position (PPP) Unknown point, don't care :) Setting Up Base Over a Known Point \u00b6 It is often the case that you will arrive on a job site that has already been surveyed and there exists a survey benchmark on this job site. Figure 3 depicts several examples of common job site survey benchmarks/markers/monuments. Figure 3 This is the best case scenario. In this procedure, you will place your base station directly over the center point of the survey marker. After the base station is secured and leveled above the marker, then you will take an accurate measurement of your base station height. See Measuring Base Height for a detailed explanation of measuring the base height. Pay Attention! The mismeasured height of the antenna above the mark is probably the most pervasive and frequent blunder in GPS control surveying.

DJI Matrice 300 RTK DJI Matrice 210 DJI Matrice 600 Power on and Connecting to the R1a \u00b6 First, ensure the supplied usb drive is inserted into the R1a. Then, power on the R1a. After powering up the unit, open Wi-Fi settings on your host computer (tablet, smartphone, or PC) and look for the wireless network labeled: ROCKrobotic-###### Connect to this network using the following password: LidarAndINS Next, open up the web browser of your choice and go to the following web address: 192.168.12.1 Configure the R1a \u00b6 In order to obtain as accurate as possible LiDAR data from the R1a, the unit needs to be configured for the data acquisition vehicle. This includes the \"IMU to Antenna Offset\" and the \"Vehicle to IMU Rotation\". If using one of the provided setup kits, the information will be provided for you. If you are using another acquisition vehicle refer to the Community for additional help. Setup your Base Station \u00b6 A highly accurate trajectory is necessary for accurate results from the R1a. In order to obtain this accurate trajectory you must use a GNSS base station. We recommend the Emlid Reach RS2 . Follow the RS2 documentation for setting up your base station. The base station should be configured to log Raw data in RINEX 3.03+ format for the entire duration of the R1a data acquisition. Calibrate the R1a \u00b6 After turning on the R1a be sure to let the R1a sit in a static position for at least 5 seconds. Before turning on the LiDAR, you will need to fly a figure 8 pattern three times to ensure the IMU is calibrated. Once calibration is complete, land the drone. Collect Data \u00b6 When you are ready to start collecting data click the 'Start' button within the web interface. The LiDAR, IMU, and GPS will all start collecting data. Proceed with your planned mission! Note: To protect the user from accidently attempting to record data while the USB is unattached, the user does not have the ability to \u201cStart\u201d data recording in the \u201cStatus\u201d window when the USB is unattached. When unattached the user will see the message shown below in Fig. 2-8. Message displayed when trying to record data while USB is unattached. At the completion of the mission you will need to fly three additional figure 8 patterns with the drone and then land. Once on the ground let the drone sit for five minutes before stopping the data collection and powering off the unit. Congratulations! You collected your first LiDAR data! Retrieve Data for Processing \u00b6 All of the LiDAR, IMU, and GPS data is written to the usb stick which is attached to the R1a. When the unit is powered off you can detach the usb and insert into your PC to begin your processing.","title":"LiDAR Acquisition with Ground Control Points"},{"location":"tutorials/Terrain-Following-Tutorial/#lidar-acquisition-with-ground-control-points","text":"","title":"LiDAR Acquisition with Ground Control Points"},{"location":"tutorials/Terrain-Following-Tutorial/#intro","text":"After you have completed the getting started tutorial and you have your ROCK R1A mounted to your drone and powered on for the first time, you can jump into this lesson.
